"""Call handler hierarchy for RTP/SIP sessions.

This module provides the :class:`Call` base dataclass that represents an
individual call leg managed by the RTP multiplexer.  Audio-specific
subclasses live in :mod:`voip.audio`.

Relationship to the rest of the stack::

    SessionInitiationProtocol   (SIP signalling)
            │
            │  creates and registers
            ▼
    RealtimeTransportProtocol   (shared UDP socket / mux)
            │
            │  routes packets to
            ▼
         Call                   (one per active call leg)
            │
         AudioCall  (audio.py)  (audio buffering + codec decode)
            │
         WhisperCall (audio.py) (speech-to-text via Whisper)
