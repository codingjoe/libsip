class SipUri:
    """A parsed SIP or SIPS URI per [RFC 3261 §19.1].

    Format: ``sip:user:password@host:port;uri-parameters?headers``

    The `parse` classmethod decodes a raw SIP URI string into structured
    fields.  IPv6 addresses in the host part must be enclosed in square
    brackets per [RFC 2732] (e.g. ``sip:alice@[::1]:5060``); the stored
    `host` is the bare address without brackets.

    [RFC 3261 §19.1]: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3261#section-19.1
    [RFC 2732]: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2732

    Examples:
        >>> SipUri.parse("sip:alice@example.com")
        SipUri(scheme='sip', user='alice', host='example.com', ...)
        >>> SipUri.parse("sips:+15551234567@carrier.com:5061")

        >>> SipUri.parse("sip:alice@[::1]:5060")
        SipUri(scheme='sip', user='alice', host=IPv6Address('::1'), port=5060, ...)

    Args:
        scheme: URI scheme — `sip` or `sips`.
        host: Host as a bare string — no brackets for IPv6 addresses.
        user: SIP user part (phone number or username).
        port: Port number. 5061 for `sips:` and 5060 for `sip:`.
        parameters: URI parameters as a mapping of name → value (`None` for flag parameters).
        headers: SIP headers as a mapping of name → value.
